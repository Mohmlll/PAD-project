# Project Agile development (PAD)

This is the second programming project I had to work with. This was the project that introduced me into NodeJS.

The goal of this website was to create a place for teachers to create and share gym games, you could filter and rate them. We were given a framework made by the university to create our website. This time we did use external libraries like bootstrap.

I had a big overall roll in this project and helped almost everywhere. But the parts I spend most of my time on this website are:
- The User login and registration.
- Game registration.
- Game filter.
- Design
- 
We were given an 8 as grade for this product.
